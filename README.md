# SOC-317-Application-Area-Analysis
This repository contains the code and scripts for my analysis of the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey Data. I look specifically at the challenges faced by students who identify as transgender. This analysis accompanies my grant proposal for my seminar on Inequality in Higher Education and is intended to fulfill the Application Area requirement for the Smith College SDS major.
